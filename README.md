# OOP and TS - TypeScript Lab Day 2

Complete the 5 exercises by filling in the missing code and finishing the different systems. Make sure to add more test cases if needed.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository on your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies listen on the `package.json` file. In this case, it will install TypeScript as a dev dependency.
3. The `tsconfig.json` file is already provided. When you run `npx tsc` on your terminal, this will compile all the TypeScript files located inside the `src/` directory and output the JavaScript files to the `dist/` directory.
4. Run `npx tsc --watch` to automatically compile whenever there are changes to your TypeScript files.
5. On another terminal, run `node dist/InventorySystem.js` to test each JS file. You need to do this because Node cannot execute TypeScript files.
6. Commit and push once you are done.
